Hungry Horses 1.0 is a two-player game where each player controls a horse on a chessboard. The board contains 14 squares with grass, 5 squares with flowers, and 2 squares with apples. When a horse eats a square of grass, the player earns one point; when a horse eats a flower, the player earns three points; and when a horse eats an apple, the player earns five points. The winner of the game is the player with the most points.

Hungry Horses 1.0 features three levels of difficulty - beginner, amateur, and expert - which the user can select upon starting the game. A minimax tree with imperfect decisions must be constructed, where the maximum depth of the tree depends on the level selected by the user. For the beginner level, a tree with a depth of 2 is used; for the amateur level, a depth of 4 is used; and for the expert level, a depth of 6 is used.
